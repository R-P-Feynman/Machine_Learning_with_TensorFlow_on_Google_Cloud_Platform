# Machine Learning with TensorFlow on Google Cloud Platform

Contains notebooks of models created and/or used as part of the Google Cloud Specialization of five courses in machine learning.  I can't guarantee that everything needed to run the scripts is included; indeed no data files are included and so you wouldn't be able to run 'as is' anyway.  Also these would not be easy to run locally (instead of on GCP) as you will hit a number of issues, especially if you're running on anything other than Linux.  So I have uploaded these for those interested in taking a look at the code rather than as 'ready to go' models.
